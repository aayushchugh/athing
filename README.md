## What?

What is this? Well, I ask that question to myself every time I start a new project. However, for phobia. I have an answer. **Phobia** is a platform that __*provides a safe, secure and an anonymous*__ environment for everyone who want's to **journal, rant, vent or help other's** in their lives.

## Why?

To put simply, **Phobia** goal is to give people a voice, To whom? To people like me. I want common voice's to heard. I want people to come together to foster an environment where a human can help his fellow kind. *Mental health is barely talked about in our society!!*. Phobia is for everyone who want's to help other's and also for everyone who just wanna rant about their day or vent in a anonymous way. I'm sure there are thousands of people who feel the same way, just like me. So I built **Phobia**.

## Ok, Cool but how?

How? Well, I'm glad you asked. Phobia is built on top of the T3 Stack. What is t3 stack? Here's a quick overview:
- T3 ensures e2e type safety. (Extremely Important)
- What is 'T3'?
  - T3 generally means, Typesafe, Tailwind and tRPC, however there is also NextJS, Next-Auth and Prisma which are all remarkable products. Combine them, you get t3.
- What is 'Typesafe'?
